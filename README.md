# Workday Scheduler 
## Description
This project is a very simple workday scheduler for tasks or appointments.  The app consists of a heading that displays the current day, date and year.  The workday is split up into eight-hour segments or time blocks starting at 9:00 AM and finishing at 5:00 PM .  Each time block represents one hour in an eight-hour workday. The user can enter text into any of the 8-hour time blocks.  The data is then stored in local storage once the save key is pressed by the user.   Also, it was interesting using DayJS in the project.  Having a temporal aspect which changes with time was a departure from the static apps that only accepted input from the user.  I learned how to incorporate data from a Web API into my code. To bring  real world data into my project. We were also introduced to jQuery.
