# Workday Scheduler 
## Description
This project is a very simple workday scheduler for tasks or appointments.  The app consists of a heading that displays the current day, date and year.  The workday is split up into eight-hour segments or time blocks starting at 9:00 AM and finishing at 5:00 PM .  Each time block represents one hour in an eight-hour workday. The user can enter text into any of the 8-hour time blocks.  The data is then stored in local storage once the save key is pressed by the user.   Also, it was interesting using DayJS in the project.  Having a temporal aspect which changes with time was a departure from the static apps that only accepted input from the user.  I learned how to incorporate data from a Web API into my code. To bring  real world data into my project. We were also introduced to jQuery.

## Installation
No installation is necessary. The app runs from the URL address: https://boilermaker74.github.io/  
## Features
The time blocks change color as time passes. The app utilizes the API DayJS to access the current time of day.  A time block is then compared to the current time of time of day.  If that time block’s time has passed, the block is colored grey.  If the block is in the current time frame it is colored red.  Future time blocks will be colored green.

The app is dynamic. The colors of the time blocks will update as time passes.
